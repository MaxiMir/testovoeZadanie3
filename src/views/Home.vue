    <p class="lead">Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike
      other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is
      focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On
      the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in
      combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</p>

    <p class="lead">If you’d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a video walking through the core
      principles and a sample project.</p>
